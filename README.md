<details>
<summary>Initial Dev Setup</summary>

This repository is structured as a monorepo and contains many Node.JS packages. Each package has its own set of commands, but the most common commands are available from the root [`package.json`](package.json) and can be accessed using the `npm run â€¦` command. Here are the only three commands you should need to start developing on the app.

```shell
# Install and Link Dependencies
npm i

# Run Lint
npm run lint

# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Run Tests
npm test

# Start App with Live Reload
npm run dev
```

### Linux

If you are on Linux, you may need to install the following supporting packages:

<details>
<summary>Ubuntu/Debian</summary>

```shell
# Update library
sudo apt-get update

# Install font configuration library & support
sudo apt-get install libfontconfig-dev
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Fedora</summary>

```shell
# Install libcurl for node-libcurl
sudo dnf install libcurl-devel
```

</details>

Also on Linux, if Electron is failing during the install process, run the following

```shell
# Clear Electron install conflicts
rm -rf ~/.cache/electron
```

### Windows

If you are on Windows and have problems, you may need to install [Windows Build Tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools)
